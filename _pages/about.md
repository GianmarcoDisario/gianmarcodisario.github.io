I started this website to commit myself to writing more about the many topics that interest me. The goal is to at least write one post every two weeks from the moment I turn 33 (5 Aug. 2025). 

The site was mainly started as a place to gather my thoughts, not necessarily to be read publicly, but thanks for visiting anyway and feel free to dive right in!
